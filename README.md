created xsl document to generate html for rentals of tools. 

The data is grouped by date rented and contains information about the user and the tool as well as the day the tool is due back and how much the charge for the tool is. There are several functions that were written to generate the due date for the tool, collect the information about the user from the tgecustomers.xml file using the doc function, and finally to calculate the charge for the tool. 

The completed html is labled tgerental and was written to resemble the example shown on canvas.
